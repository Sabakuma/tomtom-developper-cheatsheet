## Overview

This repository manages product and category documentation links for operational purposes.

## How It Works

- **Update Product and Category Links**  
  Use `links.csv` to maintain and update the collection of links for products and category documentation.

- **Manage Categories**  
  Categories are defined and updated in `categories.yml`.

## Files

- `links.csv`  
  Contains the mapping of products to their respective documentation links and categories.

- `categories.yml`  
  Stores the list of categories and their configurations.

## Maintenance Workflow

1. Edit `links.csv` to add or update product documentation links.
2. Modify `categories.yml` to manage or update category definitions.
3. Commit and push changes to keep the documentation structure consistent.
